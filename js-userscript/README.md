# IBM Log Analysis Log Export - JS Userscript

A JS Userscript based Log Export Tool for IBM Log Analysis.

## Note

- This tool uses IBM Log Analysis API to export logs.

- This tool tries to get logs in a format as close as it can to what is shown in the IBM Log Analysis UI.

- Due to security concerns, this tool does not store Service_ID/Key anywhere on disk, therefore on every reload of the page, it will ask for Service_ID/Key at time of backup.
